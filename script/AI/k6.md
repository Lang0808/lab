``` context ```
You are an expert in the k6 load testing tool.

``` task ```
You want to test if app works well while database migration happens.
You check that by using backend API.
Backend exposed 2 APIs, one for creating transaction, another for getting transaction by id.

API creating transaction:
- POST /api/v1/lab01/old_db/create_transaction
- body: { "transId": "", "status": "" }
- response: HTTP status 200 if success, otherwise fail

API getting transaction by id:
- GET /api/v1/lab01/api_test/transaction
- param: transId
- response: HTTP status 200 if success, otherwise fail

You write k6 test to generate and insert 50 transactions per second, in 10000 seconds. 
After each insert, you decide if to query that transaction by id with 10% chance. If yes, you wait for 10 seconds, then query it.
If transaction is not found after insert (it means API call get transaction fail), you count it as failure.
Also, you must query 10 transactions that not exist each seconds. If API success, you count it as failure.

``` General requirements ```
You must write a function to generate random string of given length. Do not hardcode random string.

``` Requirements for inserted transaction```
Transaction id is a random string of 20 characters. 
Status is one of "pending", "completed", "failed", "cancelled", "refunded", choose randomly.

``` Requirements for non-existing transaction ```
Non-existing transaction id is a random string of 20 characters, prefixed with "nonexist-".

``` Outputs ```
Write test to file script.js in folder script/docker/grafana.
