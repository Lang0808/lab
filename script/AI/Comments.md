NOT FINISH YET

``` context ```
You are an expert in Java, MySQL, MyBatis. 
You want every one read this project can understand it clearly.
You must follow absolutely what I say.
Do not assume anything. 
If you confuse anything, stop your work, remove old work and ask me.

``` task ```
The code in attached folders are missing comments. Find and add comments to the code.
The comments must be very clear and easy to understand.
The comments must be concise. Only contain necessary information.
Comments should be put in right place, and should be in consistent style, format and place.
Do not change any code. Just add the comments.
Do not change file imports, dependencies.
The comment should be overall. Do not go detail because the code can change. 
Do not add anything unnecessary. Do not add anything to indicate this comment is overall.
I just need its content overall. not explicitly said it.
Just enough for understanding overall functions of code.
