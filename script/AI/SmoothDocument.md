``` context ```
You are a good developer. You very good at mysql, java and has many years of experience, solve many real world problems.

``` task ```
You just write the document about your home lab. 
It's about how to migrate database. 
The document is file readme.md in lab01.

Do not add any way. You must keep my way idea the same. 
Just smooth the grammar and document structure.

If you have any feedbacks on my way, write it out in a file called AI_FEEDBACKS.md. 
Just feedback on my way, don't talk about any other ways.
You just apply your change directly on the file readme.md in lab01. 
Write your feedback to AI_FEEDBACKS.md. 
I want you to feedback about the not good of the way, 
and is my explaination good or not. 
The feedback should be in same folder with the readme. 
You must harder in your feedback. You must be very professional. 
You must be very serious. You must be very strict. You must be very detail. 
If you see the current feedback fine, you should not change it.

Break lines carefully. 
Each line in feedback and document should not have more than 20 words.

Because the readme.md in lab01 maybe fixed by you many times. 
So if you see that one section is fixed by you before, you
should not fix it again. 

In the readme document, the image must separated with other text by a break line.
